A Javafx-based graph structure display

This project aims to deliver a simple, usable API for constructing and display the typical node-edge graph.

The main component will be a <i>board</i> class, that will act as a container object for a <i>graph</i> class. This
<i>graph</i> class willl act as a container for both <i>nodes</i> and <i>edges</i>.
The client will interact primarily with this <i>graph</i> class to render nodes, edges, labels, and other displayable components.




<h4>Key functionalities to deliver</h4>
Below are key functionalities that I hope to incorporate into this project. The functionalities are expected to change throughout the project,
so a flexible software design will be necessary. A more concrete API will be developed once the underlying structure is implemented.
## Board
<ul>
<li><b>Create board:</b> Create a board to display to the user</li>
<li><b>Render board:</b> Display, or hide the board from, the user</li>
<li><b>Add graph:</b> Add a graph object to this board</li>
<li><b>Remove graph:</b> Remove a graph object from this board</li>
</ul>

## Graph
<li><b>Create graph:</b> Create an abstract graph object</li>
<li><b>Delete graph:</b>
<li><b>Add Node:</b> Add a node object to the board</li>
<li><b>Add Edge:</b> Add an edge object to the board</li>
<li><b></b></li>
<li><b></b></li>
</ul>
